## About <a name = "about"></a>
I use a combination of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv), [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), and [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) to keep track and discover new movies, shows, anime, k-dramas, etc. I also look for songs to play in both Beat Saber and Clone Hero on [Beat Saver](https://beatsaver.com) and [Chorus Encore](https://www.enchor.us). I use [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com), [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com), [GoG](https://www.gog.com), [Rockstar](https://store.rockstargames.com), and [Epic](https://store.epicgames.com) to keep track of games. I just needed a simple way to search all of them at once since lots of media appear on multiple sites.
