## About <a name = "about"></a>
I use a combination of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/), [Trakt](https://trakt.tv), [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/), and [MyDramaList](https://mydramalist.com/) to keep track and discover new movies, shows, anime, k-dramas, etc. I just needed a simple way to search all of them at once since lots of media appear on multiple sites.
